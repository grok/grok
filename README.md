ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sterling.

I like figuring things out -- usually with code, sometimes without. I've built for the web, led teams, and helped people and companies grow. The sweet spot for me is where technology, creativity, and problem-solving overlap.

I've worked with folks from all walks of life on projects for places like Google, NPM, Yosemite, and Niantic. The logos are nice, but it's the people and the shared "we actually pulled it off" moments I remember most.

When I'm not working, I'm probably adventuring with my wife, hanging out with friends, hacking on small projects, reading, gaming, or spending time with our dog Archer.
