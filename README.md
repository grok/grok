üëã Hey there!

My Name is Sterling Hamilton.

I am a software developer. Most of my career has been within the realm of web technologies, leadership, and mentorship. I've had the honor of working with many people, across many different roles with a shared passion for making a lasting impact within our teams, industries, and lives. I frequently find myself working at the intersection between technology, creativity, business, and problem-solving.

My profession is most fulfilling when realizing the potential of people and technology, to produce amazing results. From this, I have demonstrated success in large scale deployments, rapid development, creative problem solving, definition and execution of complex scopes, creation of functional requirements, technical direction, team management and leadership of both onsite and remote employees, creation and implementation of methodologies and intellectual property, security audits, risk mitigation, and disaster recovery.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with brands such as Google, NPM, Autodesk, Tahiti Tourisme, Yosemite National Park, Niantic Inc, University of California, and many more. But more than anything the people I work with are what I remember.

If you happen to speak Russian: –Ø –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏ –ø–ª–æ—Ö–æ, –Ω–æ —è —É—á—É—Å—å. üòÖ

Outside of code, I enjoy adventuring with my wife, traveling, video games, our cat Simon (–°–∏–º–æ–Ω) and our dog Archer (–ê—Ä—á–µ—Ä).

I am currently working with the amazing team at [Landing](https://www.hellolanding.com/).
