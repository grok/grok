👋 Hey there!

I'm an experienced problem solver with a demonstrated knack for leadership and mentorship. I've enjoyed a career of working with honest, hardworking people with a shared passion for making a lasting impact within our industries and disciplines. I frequently find myself working at the intersection between technology, creativity, business, and marketing.

My work has revolved around Web Development, Digital Marketing, and architecture of web applications and digital infrastructures. Additionally, I have led multiple development teams across start-ups, agencies, and corporate environments.

I find extreme fulfillment realizing the potential of people and technology, to produce amazing results. From this, I have demonstrated success in large scale deployments, rapid development, creative problem solving, definition and execution of complex scopes, creation of functional requirements, technical direction, team management and leadership of both onsite and remote employees, creation and implementation of methodologies and intellectual property, security audits, risk mitigation, and disaster recovery.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with brands such as Google, NPM, Autodesk, Tahiti Tourisme, Yosemite National Park, Niantic Inc, University of California, and many more. But more than anything the people I work with are what I remember.

I am currently working with the amazing team at Blackbird Logistics.
